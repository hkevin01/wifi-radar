# 📡 WiFi-Radar

<!-- brass-brief:intro -->
## Executive Summary For Leadership

Wifi Radar is designed to solve a specific business and process problem, not just showcase technical capability. WiFi-Radar is a Python research system for WiFi-based human pose estimation, tracking, fall detection, gait analytics, and headless monitoring. It consumes Channel State Information from commodity WiFi hardware or the built-in simulation pipeline, transforms it into learned embeddings, and emits 17-keypoint 3-D pose outputs in real time. The result is a more repeatable operating model where leadership can compare progress, quality, and impact with less ambiguity.

## Current State Without This Project

Teams lose time to repetitive setup and environment drift. This increases operational friction, slows decision cycles, and makes results harder to compare across teams.

## Why This Project Is Needed Now

This project standardizes execution patterns and reduces operational variability. As a prototype, it allows leadership to validate value early before committing to a larger rollout.

## Expected Process Improvements

- Faster delivery, fewer setup errors, and improved maintainability.
- Better executive visibility into status, bottlenecks, and next priorities.
- Clearer linkage between technical outputs and business decisions.
- Reduced rework through standardized execution patterns.

## Overview

WiFi-Radar is a Python research system for **WiFi-based human pose estimation,
tracking, fall detection, gait analytics, and headless monitoring**. It consumes
Channel State Information from commodity WiFi hardware or the built-in
simulation pipeline, transforms it into learned embeddings, and emits
17-keypoint 3-D pose outputs in real time.

This repository is aimed at **researchers, embedded/edge developers, and
privacy-first sensing prototypes** that need room-scale awareness without
cameras.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The project now uses a **src layout**. The importable package lives in
> **src/wifi_radar**, while packaging and environment files stay at the repo root.

> [!TIP]
> Start with simulation mode first, then enable the REST API or RTMP stream as
> needed.

> [!NOTE]
> Detailed implementation and reference material now lives under the docs folder,
> keeping this README focused on the project, research context, and how to run it.

## Architecture Overview

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[WiFi Router or Simulator] --> B[CSICollector]
    B --> C[SignalProcessor]
    C --> D[DualBranchEncoder]
    D --> E[PoseEstimator]
    E --> F[MultiPersonTracker]

    H --> I[GaitAnomalyDetector]
    F --> J[Dashboard]
    F --> K[REST API]
    J --> L[RTMPStreamer]
```

The runtime pipeline is organised around a single orchestration entry point in
**main.py**. CSI is collected, denoised, encoded, decoded into pose keypoints,
and then routed into tracking, fall analysis, gait analytics, optional anomaly
flagging, dashboard visualisation, RTMP streaming, and the optional REST API.

### Project takeaway

Those newer results point in a consistent direction: **hybrid, layout-aware, and
lightweight WiFi sensing pipelines generalise better in real deployments**.
That is why this repository now emphasizes:

- live CSI validation and replay,
- hybrid CSI plus pose fusion,
- stronger headless and edge deployment paths.

### Common examples

```bash
# Simulation with two virtual people
python main.py --simulation --num-people 2

# Headless embedded mode with REST API only
python main.py --simulation --api --api-port 8081 --headless

# Export ONNX models for edge deployment
python main.py --export-onnx --weights weights/simulation_baseline.pth

# Start the full dashboard + RTMP pipeline
python main.py --simulation --rtmp-url rtmp://localhost/live/wifi_radar
```

> [!NOTE]
> When the API is enabled, interactive endpoint docs are available at
> **http://localhost:8081/docs** by default.

### Configuration file

```yaml
# ~/.wifi_radar/config.yaml  (also editable live from the Configuration tab)
router:
  ip: <YOUR_ROUTER_IP>
  port: 5500
  interface: wlan0
  csi_format: atheros        # "atheros" | "intel"

system:
  simulation_mode: true
  debug: false
  max_people: 4
  confidence_threshold: 0.30
  data_dir: ~/.wifi_radar/data

dashboard:
  port: 8050
  update_interval_ms: 100
  max_history: 100

streaming:
  rtmp_url: rtmp://localhost/live/wifi_radar
  fps: 30
  bitrate: "1000k"

fall_detection:
  enabled: true
  velocity_threshold: -0.20   # normalised units / second  (negative = downward)
  angle_threshold_deg: 40.0   # body-from-vertical angle to trigger possible-fall
  alert_timeout_s: 5.0        # seconds without recovery before escalating to ALERT
```

---

## Pre-Trained Weights

A simulation-baseline checkpoint can be generated in ~2 minutes on CPU:

```bash
python scripts/train_simulation_baseline.py
# → writes weights/simulation_baseline.pth
```

Advanced options:

```bash
python scripts/train_simulation_baseline.py \
  --epochs 200 \
  --n-samples 20000 \
  --batch-size 128 \
  --lr 5e-4 \
  --output-dir weights
```

`main.py` loads `weights/simulation_baseline.pth` automatically on startup if it
exists.

---

## Multi-Person Tracking

The runtime maintains stable person identities across frames so the monitoring
stack can follow multiple occupants and associate alerts with the correct person.

---

## Fall Detection

Falls are detected from motion, posture change, and recovery state, and surfaced
live in the dashboard and API event stream.

---

## Gait Analysis

The system estimates cadence, stride, symmetry, and walking-speed proxies from
the rolling pose stream for continuous mobility monitoring.

---

## Gait Anomaly Detection

Unusual gait changes are flagged using rolling statistics and lightweight
outlier detection to provide an early warning signal.

---

## Hybrid Activity Fusion

A recent addition combines CSI motion evidence, pose confidence, and gait
signals into a more robust live activity estimate for walking, stationary,
high-motion, and possible-fall states.

---

## REST API and Headless Mode

WiFi-Radar can now run without the dashboard for embedded or service-style
integrations.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant App as main.py
    participant API as FastAPI
    participant Pipeline as Pose Pipeline
    User->>App: start with --api --headless
    App->>Pipeline: process CSI frames
    Pipeline->>API: publish status, events, gait metrics
    User->>API: GET /status
    API-->>User: JSON health and state snapshot
```

Core endpoints:

- `GET /health`
- `GET /status`
- `GET /config`
- `POST /config`
- `POST /ingest`
- `GET /people`
- `GET /events`
- `GET /metrics/gait`

Example:

```bash
python main.py --simulation --api --headless
curl http://localhost:8081/health
```

---

## Transfer Learning on Real CSI

For real-world adaptation, the repository now includes a transfer-learning
workflow that fine-tunes the simulation baseline on NPZ datasets containing:

- `amplitude`
- `phase`
- `keypoints`
- optional `confidence`

```bash
python scripts/train_transfer_learning.py data/real_world/*.npz \
  --weights weights/simulation_baseline.pth \
  --epochs 40 \
  --output weights/realworld_transfer.pth
```

The script starts with the simulation checkpoint, freezes the encoder for an
initial warm-up phase, then unfreezes the backbone for full fine-tuning.

---

## ONNX Export

Export both models for edge deployment with a single command:

```bash
# Export (requires onnx + onnxruntime)
python scripts/export_onnx.py --weights weights/simulation_baseline.pth

# Validates with onnxruntime automatically (max diff < 1e-4)
# → weights/encoder.onnx
# → weights/pose_estimator.onnx
```

Or via the main entry point:

```bash
python main.py --export-onnx --weights weights/simulation_baseline.pth
```

The exported models use **opset 17** and include **dynamic batch axes**, making
them suitable for Jetson Nano, Raspberry Pi 4 with ONNX Runtime, or any
ONNX-compatible inference engine.

```python
import onnxruntime as ort
import numpy as np

sess = ort.InferenceSession("weights/encoder.onnx", providers=["CPUExecutionProvider"])
features = sess.run(["features"], {"amplitude": amp_np, "phase": phase_np})[0]
```

---

## TensorRT Deployment

For Jetson-class hardware, WiFi-Radar now includes a helper script that builds
TensorRT engine plans from the exported ONNX models using **trtexec**.

```bash
python scripts/export_tensorrt.py \
  --precision fp16 \
  --output-dir weights/tensorrt
```

This path is best suited to **Jetson Nano / Xavier / Orin** systems where the
TensorRT runtime is already installed.

> [!WARNING]
> TensorRT engine generation is hardware-specific. Build the engine on the same
> class of NVIDIA target device you plan to deploy on.

---

## Docker Deployment

The full stack (WiFi-Radar + nginx-rtmp RTMP server) runs with one command:

```bash
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up --build
```

**Services:**

<!-- brass-brief:table-pre -->
